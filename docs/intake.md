# Intake

Intake is a conversation, not a form. The agent runs it with Clara, and its output is
written into `constraints/project.md`, `goals/outcomes.md`, `goals/goal-condition.md`, and
`goals/criteria.md`. (Executable checks in `checks/registry.md` are usually added during
goal mode as behaviours become true, not at intake.)

The point is to end with a finish line Clara agrees with and an agent that knows the
boundaries. It should take ten to twenty minutes, not an hour.

## How to run it

Ask questions in small batches — two or three at a time, not a wall. Reflect answers back
in your own words. Push on vagueness: "fast", "clean", "easy to use", and "robust" are not
outcomes until they are attached to something observable.

Do not ask about implementation. Not what stack, not what structure, not what libraries.
If Clara volunteers a technology, note it as **direction for this session** unless it is
imposed from outside — in which case it becomes a constraint with a `why:` field. See
`docs/outcome-vs-implementation.md`.

Do not write anything to disk until the end. Draft in conversation, get agreement, then
write all files in one pass.

## What to find out

**1. The problem.** What is painful, missing, or manual right now? What does she do today
instead? → `goals/outcomes.md` § Problem

**2. Who it is for.** Her alone, her team, users she will never meet? This changes what
done means more than anything else in intake. → § Who it is for

**3. The outcomes.** "When this exists, what is true that isn't true now?" Keep pulling
until each one is something you could observe. Three to six is usually right.
→ § Outcomes

**4. The non-goals.** "What are you explicitly not trying to do?" and "if I finished
early, what should I *not* start on?" These stop an agent in goal mode from wandering.
→ § Non-goals

**5. The boundaries.** "What would make you say this went wrong, even if it worked?"
That question finds real constraints faster than asking for constraints directly. Probe
for: data that must not be touched, things that must not become slow, environments it has
to run in, anything with a deadline or an external dependency.
→ `constraints/project.md`

**6. The defaults.** Show her the nine defaults in `constraints/defaults.md` in one
short list. Ask if any should be waived for this project. Most of the time none should
be — do not talk her into waiving any.

If she wants one waived, this is the one moment it is simple: governance has not engaged
yet, so set `status: waived` with her reason and note it in the log. After the baseline
exists, a waiver needs an approved proposal, and a waiver without one has no effect.

**7. Open questions.** Anything she has not decided. For each, propose an assumption the
agent will work under, and check she is fine with it.
→ `goals/outcomes.md` § Open questions

## Then draft the goal condition

Distil the outcomes into a goal condition and present it for approval or edit. This is
the part that matters most — read `docs/goal-conditions.md` before drafting.

Present it as: the one-paragraph statement (which goes in `goals/goal-condition.md`), then
the criteria with their checks (which go in `goals/criteria.md`), then "anything missing,
anything you would cut?" Expect to revise it once or twice. The goal condition itself only
carries the statement and the standing completion contract; the criteria list lives beside
it in `goals/criteria.md`.

When she approves, set `state: approved` in `goals/goal-condition.md` and record the date.

## Finish

1. Write the files: `constraints/project.md`, `goals/outcomes.md`,
   `goals/goal-condition.md`, and `goals/criteria.md`.
2. Run `python3 tools/validate.py`. Fix anything it reports. If it warns about a line
   that is genuinely fine, leave it and say why in the log — do not edit the validator to
   silence it.
3. Append an entry to `progress/log.md` recording that intake happened, what was agreed,
   and any assumptions.
4. Fill in the priming-prompt templates in `progress/priming-prompt.md` — replace the
   `Project:` line in both the worker and observer blocks with a true one-liner, so a cold
   session boots straight into this project. They shipped generic; make them real.
5. Ask her to approve in chat, then record it with
   `python3 tools/approve.py --baseline --on-behalf-of-clara "<her words>"`. This is the handover: it records
   what she approved and takes the constraints and the finish line out of your hands. Say
   so plainly rather than presenting it as a formality — from that point you propose
   changes, you do not make them.
6. Tell her she can still edit anything by hand whenever she likes; she just re-records
   in chat afterwards so the baseline matches.

## What good output looks like

A stranger should be able to read `constraints/` and `goals/` and correctly predict which
work Clara would accept and which she would reject — without having been in the
conversation, and without being told how to build any of it.
