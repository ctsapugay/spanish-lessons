"""Print the constraints, the goal condition, pending proposals, and recent progress.

    python3 tools/brief.py             # everything
    python3 tools/brief.py --goal      # just the goal condition and criteria
    python3 tools/brief.py --rules     # just the constraints
    python3 tools/brief.py --pending   # just governance: proposals and drift
    python3 tools/brief.py --working   # just the checkpoint and open blockers

Run this at the start of a session, and again periodically during a long run: after
finishing a chunk of work, before a decision that would be expensive to reverse, or
whenever you notice you have been going a while without checking. It is the re-grounding
call -- read the output, then ask whether what you are about to do stays inside the rules
and moves toward the finish line.

A waiver that Clara has not approved is shown as NOT in effect, and the constraint it
targets is listed among the rules that bind. That is not a courtesy; it is how the
loader computes the list.
