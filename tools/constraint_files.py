"""Parser and governance helpers for the constraint-base file format.

The format is Markdown with a convention:

    ## ID — Short title
    - **field:** value
    - **other:** value that may
      continue on indented lines

Every ``## `` heading starts a section. If the heading looks like ``ID — title`` (an
uppercase-ish id, a dash, a title) the section gets an id. Bullets of the form
``- **key:** value`` become fields. Everything else is prose and is ignored.

Beyond parsing, this module carries the governance layer: which proposals exist, which
have been approved, and whether the governed content still matches the approved baseline.
See docs/governance.md -- in particular the section on what is actually enforced.

Standard library only, by design. No install step.
