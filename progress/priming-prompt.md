# Priming prompts

Two paste-in blocks that boot a cold session fast — one for a **worker** (does the work in
goal mode) and one for an **observer** (watches and reports without interrupting the worker;
see `CLAUDE.md`, "Two sessions: a worker and an observer"). A priming prompt does not
replace reading `CLAUDE.md`; it points a session straight at what it needs.

**These are templates — fill them in.** They ship generic. Once intake is done, edit them
into the *real* priming prompts for this project: replace the `Project:` line with a true
one-line description, and add any project-specific pointers a fresh session would want (how
to run the app, a key doc, the current focus). Keep them current as the work moves, and
carry them to each new session. Until you edit them, they are a starting point, not the
finished prompt.

Under each heading below, everything after its `---` divider (up to the next heading) is the
block to paste.

## To boot a worker

---

You are resuming work on this project as the WORKER. Do this first, in order:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` fully — it is the entry point and explains the constraint system.
2. Run `python3 tools/brief.py` and read it: the constraints, the goal condition, the
   working state (current checkpoint and open blockers), and recent progress.
3. Read `progress/checkpoint.md` (where the work is right now), then `progress/blockers.md`
   (what is stuck), then the tail of `progress/log.md` (how it got here).
4. You are in goal mode. Work toward the goal condition inside the constraints. Keep going
   across fronts; stop only when genuinely blocked on every front, or when an action would
   be dangerous or irreversible. Log at every natural break and keep the checkpoint fresh.

Project: Spanish lessons — a local browser app with a full A1→C1 Latin American Spanish
curriculum, dashboard, lessons, practice center, and cumulative quizzes that drive progress.
Clara approves things in chat only; see "How Clara approves" in `CLAUDE.md`. Commit locally at
natural breaks; the GitHub repo `ctsapugay/spanish-lessons` is public, so never push without
Clara's explicit go-ahead. Also read
"Project notes" at the bottom of `CLAUDE.md`.

## To boot an observer

---

You are the OBSERVER for this project. A separate worker session is doing the actual work in
this same directory; your job is to give Clara status and clarity WITHOUT interrupting it.
Do this first:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — especially "Two sessions: a worker and an observer".
2. Run `python3 tools/status.py` for the one-screen state; `python3 tools/brief.py` and
   `progress/log.md` for the fuller picture.
3. To see what the worker is actually doing, read its live session (`list_sessions`, then
   `list_events`, or `search_session_transcripts`). Reading it does not interrupt the worker.

You are READ-ONLY over the constraint system: do not edit `constraints/`, `goals/`,
`progress/`, or `checks/`, and do not run `approve.py` or `verify.py` (they change state or
belong to the worker's turn). Answer Clara's questions and check in when she prompts;
otherwise stay quiet. Report what you see; do not act.
